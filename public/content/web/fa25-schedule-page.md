**Fall 2025:** 

**Lecture**: Tuesday 6:30pm-8pm @ [SOCS 20](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/social-sciences-building/)._

**Instruction begins on the week of 9/8. First lecture is Tuesday 9/9.**

## Announcements
Join the [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/join/7TP6cS) and [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) with code **7XN55E**.

Cubstart is a Decal offered by Hackathons @ Berkeley (the team behind Cal Hacks). It's an introduction to building fullstack web applications. By the end of the course, you'll:

* Be able to ship real-world projects.
* Have experience with a range of technologies, both frontend and backend.
* Be able to take initiative as a developer.
* Feel comfortable debugging on your own.

## Structure

This class will meet once a week every Thursday. Each session will have a different theme (see below for the calendar). After a brief mini-lecture, each student will work on a project of their own. For example, for our first session, every student will make their own personal website. At the end of each session, students will share what they've made with their peers and course staff.

The last four weeks will be dedicated to your final project, which is ideating and building a viable product/application. You‚Äôll work with a team or alone; we will be offering office hours support along the way. Besides the final project, there'll be no homework for this semester.

## Communication

All students should join the class' [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/join/7TP6cS). We encourage you to make your posts public as other students may have similar questions. If you need to contact us about a private matter, please make a private Ed post.

## Submissions

Students should make a PR to this repository every week with the project they made that week. There'll be a corresponding folder, eg. `week1`. Final projects should be submitted as a GitHub repository.

## Requirements

We do not enforce prerequisites, but prior coding experience of any kind is recommended (high school course, CS10, CS61A, etc). Students should come to the first session of class w/ an IDE (we recommend VSCode), Node.js, and GitHub Desktop installed.

Above all, bring positivity and curiosity to class! The more you give to the class, the more you'll get out of it.
