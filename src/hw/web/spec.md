# Final Project Specification

<!-- _**Please fill out the [Team Formation Form](https://forms.gle/QqXi5eJ84rzgP3tR8) DUE SUNDAY MARCH 24th!**_ -->

Your goal is to design and develop a web application that incorporates the following:

1. Content, Structure, and Style (HTML + CSS)
2. Interactivity (JavaScript)
3. An API (whether that be a pre-existing API or a custom server)

Other than that, the final project is very open-ended! Be creative and build anything you want.

For those with prior web dev experience, we encourage you to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. Impress us!

## Part 1: Final Project Checkpoint (Project Proposal + Design Mockup)
**Deadline:** Tuesday, April 9th

**Grade:** 10 points

_<b>Action Item:</b> With your project team, fill out the [Final Project Checkpoint on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/709491/assignments/4257372) that consists of the parts listed below. Only one person should submit the assignment for your entire team, and then add the other teammates as collaborators._

### Project Proposal

The project proposal and design mockup is how you will flesh out exactly what you want to build over the next couple weeks, identify why you're building it, and plan what technologies/tools/skills you need.

- **Project Name:** Come up with a cool name for your application!

- **Application Description:** Write a short description of your project. If it solves a problem, include the description of the problem and how the application approaches it.

- **Features + Tools/Technologies:** Describe the functionalities of the app. For each feature, mention the tools/technologies that you may need to implement this feature.

- **Timeline:** When do you plan to work on certain portions of your project, and in what order? What work will you aim to complete by certain checkpoints? How will you and your team split up the work? Will your team be setting up regular meetings? If so, will they be virtual or in-person?

### Design Mockup

Come up with a design to demonstrate your project idea using any design tool you'd like (we recommend Figma), and export it as an image or PDF. Bring your vision to life! Include colors, try different fonts, and mess with corner radius or effects like drop shadows. Here is an example:

## Tips + Advice
- Attend Project Office Hours (check the schedule for dates/times). 
- Get started early.
- Collaborate with your group together in person.
- Reference the materials we have provided you (slides, homeworks, recordings, etc).
- Take time to read API documentation.
- Use Postman as a tool to test API endpoints.
- USE THE INTERNET AS A RESOURCE! [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are great resources.
