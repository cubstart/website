# HW 4: Deployment

## Objective
The objective for this week's homework is to deploy your own personal website! This can be something you made yourself or what you made in Homework 2. You should at least have a folder with the files **index.html** and **styles.css** in it. This is what we will be using for the rest of the homework. You can use **[HW2 solution](assets/hw2/answers.zip)** to check through your current index.html and styles.css.

## Conceptual Explanation
We are going to create a new repository. A repository is essentially a folder to store all our code. This could be on your local computer or online (on Github's servers). We are going to use our personal portfolio files in the local repository, then publish it online. Then, now that it is on Github's servers, Github will host these files for us. (This means that when a browser on a computer sends a request to see the website, Github will send the HTML and CSS files to that computer, allowing the user to view and interact with the website.)

## Optional: Install Github Desktop
_If you are familiar with Git already and know how to create repositories, you can skip this part!_

1. Download the Github Desktop installer from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Run "GitHubDesktopSetup.exe" to install Github Desktop.

If you don't have a Github account, make one [here](https://www.github.com).

You can then login to Github Desktop with your Github account, which will take yu to this authorization page.

Click "Authorize Desktop". 

An alert might pop-up on your browser asking if you want to open Github Desktop. Click "Yes" or "Run".

On this screen, make sure the Github account name and email address are correct. After that, click "Finish" here.

Click "Create a New Repository on your hard drive". Fill in the name and description however you want. 

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-5.png" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

You can edit your repository by opening it in Visual Studio Code. You can also view the files of your repository in your file explorer.

Now that we're done with set-up, we can start by adding our files to our repository. 

## Adding Our Files

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-5.png" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

View the files of your repository in your file explorer. Then, drag your **index.html** and **styles.css** into that file.

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-6.PNG" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

When we switch back to our Github Desktop window, we see all the files and lines we added by doing this. (Github tracks your changes!)

Make sure the changed files are ticked, add a **Summary** and **Commit to main**. Commits allow Github to track changes between commits, so it's essentially saving your work between iterations.

Finally, publish your repository! This allows you to access you repository from Github online.

## Making your Repository Public

You can either navigate to [Github](https://www.github.com) yourself or click "View on Github" in Github Desktop.

Then, go to your Settings.

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-11.png" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Now, under "General", you can scroll down to the bottom to see the **Danger Zone**. This allows you to change the visibility of your repository so everyone has access to the files. 

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-12.png" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Just type your name/repo-name to confirm this.

## Using Github Pages

The Settings bar has a "Pages" tab. Click on it.

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-14.PNG" style="padding: 20px 0;"/>

Now, you can finally **deploy your branch**!

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-15.PNG" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

This kicks off a Github workflow/action (Github is fixing stuff up for you) to deploy your site. The progress can be seen here.

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-16.PNG" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Now anytime you make changes to your site, you can commit and push these changes to update the repository. We can do this in Github Desktop here.

<img src="/assets/hw4/github-desktop-17.PNG" style="width: 60%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

## Viewing your Website

You can see your website at: YOUR_USERNAME_HERE.github.io/REPO_NAME_HERE (e.g. steffitan23.github.io/demo).

## Submission

We'd love to see your websites, but this is totally optional. Just submit the link [here](https://forms.gle/myvdXsY5KMiqmnxD9).
