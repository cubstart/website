# Introduction 👋

Welcome to Cubstart! For your first homework, you’ll be designing an iOS app of your choosing! There will be no coding involved and you will just be familiarizing yourself with UI design using Figma. Feel free to collaborate with your teammates on this homework, but remember that everyone has to submit their own homework.

# Getting Started 📝

## Creating an Account

- Go to [figma.com/signup](http://figma.com/signup)
- Use your Berkeley email to access your free Figma Pro Plan (You DO NOT need Figma Pro for this assignment, getting verified for the Pro Plan may take time)

## Figma Basics

Once you’re logged into your Figma account, create a new “New design file” by clicking on the button at the top of your homepage.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/start.png"/>

At the top of your screen is your toolbar. You can also rename your file here.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/tools.png"/>

From left to right, here is a brief description of each of your tools:

- Move tool 🚗 - Allows you to interact with elements
- Frame tool 🖼️ - Imports frames for you to design
- Rectangle tool 🟥 - Inserts rectangles and other shapes/images
- Pen tool 🖋️ - Draws/writes directly onto the design
- Text tool ✏️ - Inserts text onto the design
- Resources tool 🧩 - Allows you to access different resources/plugins
- Hand tool ✋ - Allows you to grab and move elements
- Comment tool 💬 - Adds comments

Select the Frame tool.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/frame.png" style="width: 40%; height: 100%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Create an iPhone 14 frame by selecting it on the righthand menu.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/prototype.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Use the Rectangle tool to shape a basic button. Explore the different design tools that are available to you on the right menu, the most important ones are captioned.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/capsule.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Next use the Text tool to label the button. Explore the design tools available to you, although most of them are the same as the Rectangle tool. There is a unique text editing section that should look familiar to you. Here you can control font, size, bolding, etc.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/text.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Create another iPhone 14 frame and then select the Prototype tab on the top-right of the righthand menu. Here you can map out which frames interacting with an element will take you to.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/share.png" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Select the “Next button” and drag and drop the arrow to the second frame.

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/flow.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Here you can also change the type of interaction required to trigger the frame change as well as the animation used in the frame change.

Finally, click on the play button in the top right to simulate your prototype!

<img src="/assets/hw1ios/play.png" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; padding: 20px 0;"/>

Now it’s your turn!

# Creating Your App 🤖

Today you will be designing an app of your choosing! However, there are some requirements on the pages and elements included, which I’ll help guide you through. We’ll also be creating the design flow so that the app’s UI can be presented as a functional prototype. Be creative since this is your chance to mess around and learn how to use Figma!

## Welcome Screen

Let’s start by building a welcome screen for our app. Here you should display your app’s logo and name as well as a button/prompt to go to the next screen.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/bearShop.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

For my app, I will be designing a local shopping platform called bearShop! Remember, to begin your project create a new iPhone 14 frame using the Frame tool. Use the Text and Rectangle tools to add any elements or images that you need. Please check the Getting Started section if you forgot how to use a tool.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/assets.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

You can also change the background color of the frame by selecting it in the lefthand menu and changing the fill in the righthand menu.

You can find a logo for your app on the internet or design your own. [Here’s a site](https://icons8.com/) where you can find free-to-use images for your logo or any other icons in your app.

## Log-in Screen

Next you’ll be creating a log-in screen for your users. Here you must include elements where a user could enter their username, password, and then log-in. While prototyping in Figma however, you don’t actually have to be able to type into the boxes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/login.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

You can also create additional frames for “Forgot password?” and “Sign up” buttons for extra practice.

## Main Page

This is where the main functionality of your app should go. In my example, this is where users can shop for different categories of products. Make sure to use aesthetically pleasing colors and elements to make the UI look good for the user!

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/shop.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

You are also expected to include a navigation bar with at least four icons at the bottom of the page. I’ll be guiding you through the creation of two of the other pages, but the fourth one will be up to you! Remember you can look [here](https://icons8.com/) for icons to use.

## Profile

Here you will be creating a profile page for the user. You should make sure to include space for a profile picture, the user’s account information, a log-out button, and at least one other section relevant to your app. Feel free to reference my example to see what should be included.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/profile.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

## Settings

Here you will creating a settings page for the user. The users should see some basic settings that they can control relevant to your app. There should be at least four different setting options/buttons on this page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/settings.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

## Your Page

Lastly, you will be creating a page unique to your app that you’re interested in adding! As an example, in my app I added a chat page.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/chat.png" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

Feel free to create whatever page you see fit, but make sure you have at least five unique elements on this page. Try to be creative and utilize any tools you haven’t explored yet. If you are unsure of what you want your page to be, feel free to create your own version of a chat page.

# Design Flow 🌊

Finally, we will wrap this Figma prototype up by creating our design flow. As you may recall from earlier, all you need to do is select the “Prototype” tab in the top-right and then drag and drop arrows from elements to frames! Here’s an example of what your finished product should look like.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/hw1ios/complete.png" style="width: 75%; height: 75%; padding: 20px 0;"/>
</p>

To begin with, make sure that you can tap on your welcome screen to go to the log-in screen. Then you should be able to press your log-in button to go to your main page. At this point you should assign flows for each of your many interactions. In particular, ensure that your navigation bar is fully functional in every frame and can take you to any other page on the bar. Feel free to play with the interaction and animation types of any of the flows. The result should be a fully-functional prototype of your app’s UI!
