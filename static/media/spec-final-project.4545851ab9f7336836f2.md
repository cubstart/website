## Part 1: Project Proposal + Design Mockup 
_<b>Deadline:</b> 7 April 2022, <b>5 points</b></br>
<b>ðŸ¥³Extended to 9 April 2022ðŸ¥³</b>_

The project proposal and design mockup is how you will flesh out exactly what you want to build over the next couple weeks, identify why you're building it and what tools/skills you need, and receive feedback on the feasibility of your idea.

### Project Proposal
_<b>Action Item:</b> With your project team, submit [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/4NeXsDK1Ek3k5FaD8) to address each of the following points with a brief description by 7 April 2023 (extended to 9 April instead)._
- **Basic information**

- **Names of each group member**

- **Project Name:** Come up with a cool name for your application if you would like!

- **Domain:** Identify the field or area that the application is focused on.

- **Application Idea:** Write a short description of the application that you are looking to build. If it solves a problem, include the description of the problem and how the application approaches it.

- **Features + Tools/Technologies:** Describe the functionalities of the app. For each feature, put down ideas for the tools/technologies that you may need to implement this feature.

- **Timeline:** What work will you aim to complete by the following checkpoint? 'Work' can include learning some new skills, developing the features you listed above, or anything else you want. This is suggested just to keep your group on track to complete the project. 

- **Design Mockup PDF**: Submit a PDF file of your design mockup (specifications below).

### Design Mockup
This week, you'll be mocking up the design of your application using any design tool of your choice! Drafting a design is a crucial step before starting to build a hackathon project. It's not uncommon for teammates to have differing visions of their app, and deciding upon a design early-on gets everyone onto the same page. It also makes the idea that you'll be working towards over the next couple weeks, much more tangible. We hope that you have fun with this! Like most of the project, you get out as much as you put into your design.

**Specifications**

1. Come up with **3 different designs** to demonstrate your project idea! These don't have to look great (no color, just basic shapes, placeholder text, etc.), but we want you to explore different ways to design your app! These designs should each be variations of the same screen(s). Below is an example of what this might look like if you're building an iOS app. If you're developing a web app, yours will look very similar, just with different frame dimensions.

2. Pick 1 design that your team thinks is the best for your project, and bring your vision to life! Add colors, try different fonts, mess with corner radius or effects like drop shadows.

3. Make **at least 2 fleshed out screens** that are different from the one you made in **Part 1**. We encourage you to keep going and finish designing as much of your app as you can. The more work you do now, the less you'll have to do in the future!

4. Submit it in Gradescope.

## Part 2: Final Project Presentation
_<b>Deadline:</b> 2 May 2023, <b>40 points</b>_

Demo Day will be held on **2 May 2023**. (Details tbc)

You'll be given **3 minutes to present + 1 minute for Q&A.** We will set up a Gradescope assignment to submit your slides and your iOS/Web application files.

| Points | Category                         | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

| 10     | **Presentation**                 | How effective is your presentation in communicating the goals, features, and improvements for your iOS/Web application?                                      |
| 15     | **Quality**                      | How functional and polished is your iOS/Web application? What features does your application have? How easy is your application to use?                      |
| 5      | **Technologies, frameworks used**| Are the technologies and frameworks you used relevant to your iOS/Web application? How much syllabus knowledge did you use to make your iOS/Web application? |
| 5      | **Purpose**                      | Does this iOS/Web application have an interesting, unique, and/or useful purpose?                                                                            |
